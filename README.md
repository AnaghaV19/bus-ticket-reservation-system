 # OVERVIEW

The bus ticket reservation system is a web-based application that permits users to reserve bus tickets through the online system without a need to queue up at the counter to book a bus ticket. This project develops a database management system, which would serve the basic functionalities of bus ticket reservation system. It would accept database administration and SQL commands. The SQL interpreter then interprets these commands. The result of interpretation is then transformed into an understandable form. In this system, the bus details are updated periodically by the admin and users can also view bus details and book their tickets for their desired bus. It enables admin to add, modify and delete bus details and admin can also view user details who have logged in to system and the  details of the passengers who have booked their tickets. It also enables customers/users to check the availability of various buses and its details through online. The users can log in to  the system to book tickets to their desired location and are allowed to update their profile, print their tickets and also cancel their tickets by viewing their previous and current bookings. Users can use this application directly on their websites at any place and time.
